# Apply Machine Learning in the Company to Predict the Quality of Sales Leads

This repository is part of the thesis of the Master's in Data Science by the University of Barcelona 2019/2020.

This work has been done with the collaboration of the EMEA 3D sales team in HP. The dataset in which the project is based on is currently more than 40,500 leads from the fiscal year 2016 quarter 1 to the fiscal year 2020 quarter 4. On average, every week 257 new leads are entered into the system.

The main objective of this project is to develop a data science pipeline, capable of predicting, for every lead, the quality of it. Meaning quality, the probability in which the lead is going to become a possible sell, and to advance to the next sale stages. By doing this, we want to **achieve a transition from decisions based on intuition from the salesman, to more data-driven decision-making with the use of a score, from 0 to 1, that will be an indication of the quality of the lead.**

The pipeline developed is widely explained in the thesis file found in this repository. But the main structure of the pipeline is exposed below:
